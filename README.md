ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bikram!

I'm a newly minted Junior Full Stack Developer coding in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, SQL. Frameworks I've worked with: Flask, Django, React, Node.js. Love working with REST APIs and PostgreSQL/Postman databases on backend. I'm currently coding 8-10 hours a day and I love every minute of it. I can't wait to find my first full time opportunity.

I have a particular interest in translating UI designs into reality, AI generative tools to solve problems, clean, refactored code, testing and TDD, and would love to learn more about Cloud hosting.
